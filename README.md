This repository contains the completed tasks assigned during my MicroIT internship. Each project demonstrates the practical application of front-end web development skills using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Project 1: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
I developed an interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game that allows users to play against the computer. The project includes user-friendly UI, randomized computer choices, score tracking, and responsive design. This task helped me understand DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.

Project 2: Calculator
I built a basic calculator that performs arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator features a clean layout, responsive design, and accurate operation handling. This project improved my understanding of JavaScript functions, button events, and dynamic input/output rendering.

Overall, this internship gave me practical experience and improved my web development skills. All code is uploaded and organized for easy access and review. Feel free to explore each project folder for details.
